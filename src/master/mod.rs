//! Mesh simulator Master module
//! This module defines the Master struct, which represents the master process 
//! in the Mesh deployment.
//! The master process has the following responsibilities:
//!   1. Read the test case and transform it to run-time parameters.
//!   2. Start the number of processes indicated in the test case.
//!   3. Configure each process with the appropriate parameters.
//!   4. Keep track of the life-time of the processes.
//!   5. Kill any processes required by the test especification.
