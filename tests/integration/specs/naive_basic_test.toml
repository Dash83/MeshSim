#This test is designed to run for 6 seconds, such that each worker can trigger it's heartbeat-timer once
#and complete the heartbeat-handshake.
#We used 1 initial node and add a second node shortly after to a potential deadlock in which the 2 process
#start at the exact same time and end up waiting on the other to responde to the heartbeat message.
