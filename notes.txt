#Raspberry Pi + Rust
https://hackernoon.com/compiling-rust-for-the-raspberry-pi-49fdcd7df658


#Current Problems
##Cross compilation fails.
###Possible Solutions
    *Remove nanomsg dependency
    *Install nanomsg cross-compiled library
    *Compile on the RPI every time.
##Network operations fail some times.
###Possible Solutions
    *Change network library
        *Would also fix cross-compile issues.
        *No guarantee it will fix things.
        *Might be too late/difficult to do.
    *Keep debugging the code until a fix is found.
        *Frustrating, but should be effective.
        *I don't know where to start. The calls my code makes are succesful.
##Can't developt on my Mac
    *This is a major problem, since I won't finish here and I need to keep coding while on the trip.
###Possible Solutions
    *Change avahi for bonjour when on Mac (horrible idea, but possible).
    *Setup VM to compile and run examples on Mac.
    
#Missing features for demo
##Fully functioning network capabilities.
##Coding the protocol that will be displayed.
##Outputting data I can show.
